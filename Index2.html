      <h2>Early life and career</h2>
      <p>
        Iqbal was born at Sialkot, India (now in Pakistan), of a pious family of
        small merchants and was educated at Government College, Lahore. <br />In
        Europe from 1905 to 1908, he earned a degree in philosophy from the
        University of Cambridge, qualified as a barrister in London, and
        received a doctorate from the University of Munich. <br />His thesis,
        The Development of Metaphysics in Persia, revealed some aspects of
        Islamic mysticism formerly unknown in Europe. <br />On his return from
        Europe, he gained his livelihood by the practice of law, but his fame
        came from his Persian- and Urdu-language poetry,<br />
        which was written in the classical style for public recitation. Through
        poetic symposia and in a milieu in which memorizing verse was customary,
        his poetry became widely known.
